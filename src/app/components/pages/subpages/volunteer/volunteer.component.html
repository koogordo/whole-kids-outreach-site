        <p>
          Volunteers are welcomed onto the WKO property throughout the year for a variety of activities.
          The length of any given volunteer experience varies from an hour to a whole week, and
          volunteers can be individuals or groups, young or old.
          Each volunteer is acclimated to the expectations of the assigned tasks through a thorough
          orientation.
          This orientation also helps connect the service project with the overall mission of WKO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Volunteers who participate in extended projects (more than one day) have the chance to be involved
          in a variety of dynamic projects such as:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>service activities with the WKO grounds and maintenance team</li>
            <li>recreational activities with children of all ages</li>
            <li>community outreach activities for WKO clientele who need help with home improvements to
            improve the safety of their living environments</li>
            <li>Camp Whole Kids, WKOâ€™s four-week summer day camp</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Off-site volunteer opportunities are also available and welcomed.
            These activities may be as small as running a lemonade stand, or as involved as building this website.
            For large projects, it is best to coordinate with the WKO staff up front.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some example opportunities of past projects include:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>supporting the WKO Christmas Store with gifts and logistics</li>
              <li>conducting local fundraising events</li>
              <li>providing administrative and technology support</li>
